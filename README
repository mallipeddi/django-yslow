Django YSlow plugin
Author: Harish Mallipeddi (harish.mallipeddi@gmail.com)

This Django utility adds new management commands & a couple of template tags which let you generate optimized builds of your Django application. Best practices recommended by Yahoo's YSlow project are adopted. If you're using Amazon S3 for hosting static files, you can use the upload_to_s3 management command to upload to S3 easily.

This project should be of interest to you if you're writing a Django app and would like to achieve better YSlow grades!
