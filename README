Author: Harish Mallipeddi (harish.mallipeddi@gmail.com)

This Django utility adds new management commands & a couple of template tags which let you generate optimized builds of your Django application. Best practices recommended by Yahoo's YSlow project are adopted.

This project should be of interest to you if you're writing a Django app and would like to achieve better YSlow grades!
